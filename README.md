# ADB Helper

Desktop app aimed to simplify some routine ADB operations.

Initially developed to simplify Wireless debugging (searching, pairing and connecting devices) without Android Studio.
But I plan to implement more features. Feel free to create an issue if you want some feature to be implemented sooner.

Also check out my CLI tool with similar features: https://github.com/downace/adb-helper-cli
